# Cyclistics Customer Comparison - Google Data Analytics Capstone
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone project through Coursera. It analyzes customer ride patterns for the ficticious bike share company 'Cyclistic' to compare behavior between casual and member riders. In this scenario, insights from the project will be used to design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into members. 

## Technologies Used
- SQL (Data cleaning and transformation)
- Tableau (Data visualization)

## Data Sources
The data for this project were sourced from the [Divvy bicycle sharing service](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement), which is operated by Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC. 
The raw trip data can be accessed directly through the following [link to the zip files](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 12 months of Cyclistic bike share data to compare how casual and member riders use the service. The analysis includes:
- Ride counts and frequencies
- Ride distance and duration
- Time of day and weekday usage
- Geographic location patterns

## Key Findings
- Casual riders account for 40% of total rides in summer months and only 20% in winter months
- Member riders tend to use the service to commute and ride more on week days. 
- Casual riders tend to use the service for leisure and ride more on weekends. 
- Riders travel similar average distances, but the average durations are shorter for members and longer for casual riders. 
- The top 50 starting locations for casual riders are located closer to the water front downtown.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into how casual riders use Cyclistic services primarily for leisure during weekends, closer to the waterfront, and more frequently in the warmer months. Additionally, the data show that members tend to use Cyclistic services for commuting, with an average ride duration of 10-12 minutes during peak commute times. Based on these findings, a targeted marketing strategy could focus on encouraging casual riders to consider cycling for commuting during Chicago's warmer months, emphasizing the convenience, health benefits, and environmental impact of cycling to work.
